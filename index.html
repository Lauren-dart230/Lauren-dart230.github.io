        <h1> Because We Match</h1>
        <p><em> We are one in the same.</em></p>
        <p>You're so full of life while I drain it from people.<br> You were made to rebuild what I broke.</p>
        <p><em> We are two halves of one whole.</em></p>
        <p>You exist in sunshine and I am only visible in the shadows. <br>People gravitate towards you while pushing me away.</p>
        <p><em>We can't exist without each other.</em></p>
        <p>You are the <strong> strike that started the flame that made my whole world burn down</strong><br>While I am nothing but the <strong>kindling that turned to me to ash</strong></p>
        <p> And all of this makes sense <em><strong> Because We Match</strong></em></p>
